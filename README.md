    <h1>Food Vision</h1>
    <p>A machine learning model that takes images of food and predicts its name with high accuracy.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Food Vision is an AI model built using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The model has been trained on a large dataset of food images, and can accurately predict the name of food dishes in images with over 95% accuracy. This can be useful in many real-world applications such as meal tracking, food recognition for calorie counting, and more.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use Food Vision, you need to provide an image of a food dish as input. The model will then output a predicted label for the dish. The model can be used in a variety of settings, including web applications, mobile apps, and desktop software.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python 3.6 or higher</li>
      <li>TensorFlow 2.0 or higher</li>
      <li>Numpy</li>
      <li>OpenCV</li>
      <li>Matplotlib (for visualizing results)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Web Application</h2>
    <p>Food Vision has a web application built using React and Flask. The React frontend, using Material UI, provides an interface for users to input an image of food and view the prediction results. The Flask backend serves as the API that communicates with the machine learning model and returns the prediction results to the React frontend.</p>
    <p>To start the web application, navigate to the 'client' folder and run the command 'npm start'. The Flask server can be started by running the 'server.py' file in the same 'client' folder.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <h3>Clone the repository:</h3>
    <pre>
      git clone https://github.com/[username]/food-vision.git
    </pre>
    <h3>Install the required packages:</h3>
    <pre>
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    </pre>
    <h3>Start the Flask server:</h3>
    <pre>
      python server.py
    </pre>
    <h3>Start the React app:</h3>
    <pre>
      cd client
      npm start
    </pre>
    <p>Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to access the Food Vision web application.</p>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>To use the Food Vision web application, simply input an image of food using the provided interface and view the prediction results. The prediction results will be displayed as the dish name predicted by the machine learning model.</p>
